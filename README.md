# Netflix Clone

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This repository contains the code for a Netflix-like application. This README provides instructions for setting up Jenkins to automate builds and deployments using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed and configured on your Jenkins server:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Maven**
- **Jenkins**
- **Docker**

## Jenkins Setup

### 1. Verify Installations

Ensure that Maven, Jenkins, and Docker are correctly installed:

- **Maven**: Run `mvn -version` to check Maven's version.
- **Jenkins**: Open Jenkins in your browser at `http://<your-server-ip>:8080` and ensure itâ€™s running.
- **Docker**: Run `docker --version` to check Docker's version.

### 2. Configure Jenkins

#### Access Jenkins

Open Jenkins by navigating to `http://<your-server-ip>:8080` and log in with the initial admin password found in `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.

#### Install Plugins

Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins** and install the following essential plugins:

- **Docker Pipeline**: Integrates Docker with Jenkins.
- **Pipeline**: Enables the creation of Jenkins pipelines.
- **Maven Integration**: Supports Maven builds.

#### Configure Global Tools

Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Global Tool Configuration** and configure Maven and Docker if necessary.

#### Set Up Jenkins Credentials

Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials** and add credentials for accessing private repositories or Docker registries if required.

### 3. Create a Jenkins Pipeline

#### Create a New Job

1. Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click **New Item**.
2. Select **Pipeline** and give it a name.

#### Configure the Pipeline

In the pipeline configuration, under the **Pipeline** section, set the **Definition** to **Pipeline script** and enter the following script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/seelimsii/Netflix-clone.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build('netflix-clone')
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Docker Container') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.image('netflix-clone').run('-d -p 80:80')
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'Pipeline finished.'
        }
    }
}
```

Replace placeholders as needed. Ensure the Dockerfile is located in the root of your repository, or adjust the path in the `docker.build` command accordingly.

### 4. Test the Pipeline

1. Trigger the pipeline by going to the job you created and clicking **Build Now**.
2. Monitor the build progress and logs to ensure everything is working correctly.

### 5. Setup Automated Builds and Deployments

#### Webhooks

Set up webhooks in your Git repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab) to trigger Jenkins builds on code changes.

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Extend your pipeline to include additional stages such as tests, security checks, and deployments to different environments.

### 6. Secure and Optimize

#### Secure Jenkins

Set up authentication and authorization for Jenkins users and configure security settings to protect Jenkins from unauthorized access.

#### Resource Management

Monitor and manage resources on your server to ensure it handles build and deployment workloads efficiently.

#### Backup

Regularly back up Jenkins configurations and job data.

### 7. Additional Tools and Configurations

#### Add Plugins

Install additional Jenkins plugins as needed (e.g., for notifications, code quality analysis).

#### Set Up Notifications

Configure email notifications or integrations with chat tools (e.g., Slack) for build statuses.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following:

- **Check Jenkins Logs**: Located at `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`.
- **Rebuild Docker Image Manually**: Ensure there are no issues with the Dockerfile or Docker setup.
- **Test Docker Commands in Jenkins**: Create a simple Jenkins job with Docker commands to ensure Docker functionality.

For further assistance or specific issues, please feel free to ask!

Feel free to modify this template according to your specific setup or additional details you want to include. Once you have the README ready, you can add it to your GitHub repository by creating a `README.md` file in the root of your repository and committing it.
